# Experimental Platform Prototypes

This directory contains experimental prototype implementations of Time Warp for various platforms. These are **not actively maintained** and are provided for historical reference and experimentation only.

**Note:** The primary and actively maintained implementation is now the Python version at the repository root. See the main README.md for current usage.

## Experimental Prototypes

- `dos/` – MS-DOS / DOSBox build written in portable C
- `python/` – Primary implementation with PySide6 GUI (actively maintained)
- `web/` – Browser-based implementation (HTML5/JS)
- `win2000/` – Windows 2000 implementation (Win32/C)

## Status

The Python implementation is the **actively maintained** version. Other implementations are experimental prototypes and may not work correctly. They are kept for historical reference but are not recommended for actual use.

## Historical Notes

These directories were previously located at the repository root and named using the "Time Warp <Platform>" convention. The reorganization completed in November 2025 moved them into `platforms/` to consolidate all implementations.
