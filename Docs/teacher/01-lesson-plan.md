# Teacher Lesson Plan — Time Warp IDE

This lesson plan is designed for a 6-week introductory course using Time Warp IDE. The plan maps directly to the Student Workbook and includes learning objectives, essential materials, sample activities, and assessment criteria for each week.

---

## Overview

Course length: 6 weeks (recommended) — 45–60 minute lessons, 3 lessons per week.

Audience: Middle school or early high school students (ages 11–15) with minimal prior programming experience.

Learning outcomes:

- Understand basic programming concepts: variables, I/O, control flow (if, loops)
- Gain hands-on experience with procedural programming using BASIC and PILOT
- Explore turtle graphics and procedures in Logo for computational thinking and creativity
- Learn modularity and structured programming with Pascal concepts
- Intro to logic programming (Prolog) and systems-level thinking (C) for advanced classes

Materials required:

- Computers with Time Warp IDE installed or access to portable bundle
- Projector / screen for demonstrations
- Worksheets or printer-friendly copies of workbook lessons
- Optional: USB/Local network for sharing student files

Assessment approach:

- Formative: in-class exercises, exit tickets, pair programming checks
- Summative: projects (Guessing Game, Turtle Art Gallery, Choose Your Adventure)
- Rubrics: Functionality, Code Quality, Documentation, Creativity, Testing

## Week-by-week plan (6 weeks)

### Week 1 — Getting Started (BASIC)

Objectives
- Run your first program, understand the editor, run and stop programs
- Use PRINT, LET, INPUT

Lesson 1: Hello, World!
- Show pre-built turtle demo as hook
- Students type and run Hello world in BASIC
- Exit ticket: "One thing you learned, one question you have"

Lesson 2: Variables and I/O
- Guided exercises from Student Workbook Unit 1
- Short pairing activity: personalize an introduction program

Lesson 3: Control flow & small project
- IF statements and basic branching
- Mini-project: interactive questionnaire and small branching story

Assessment: small quiz and code review (forms or quick hands-on)

### Week 2 — Repetition and Subroutines (BASIC)

Objectives
- Use loops and simple subroutines (GOSUB, RETURN), prefer structured solutions

Lesson 1: FOR, WHILE loops
- Exercises: counters, loops, times table generator

Lesson 2: Subroutines & simple state
- Build a small menu-driven app or a number game using subroutines

Lesson 3: Complete Guessing Game project

Assessment: Project demonstrating loop and subroutine use

### Week 3 — Visual Programming (Logo)

Objectives
- Learn turtle basics, procedures, parameters
- Use graphics to teach geometry and iterative thinking

Lesson 1: Turtle basics and procedural thinking

Lesson 2: Drawing shapes and colors

Lesson 3: Spiral / recursive drawings and parameterized procedures

Assessment: Turtle art mini-showcase — students present their best pattern

### Week 4 — Structured Programming (Pascal) + Refactoring

Objectives
- Introduce typed variables and functions
- Translate small BASIC programs into Pascal-style structure

Lesson 1: Pascal syntax, program structure, and simple I/O

Lesson 2: Functions, parameters, and using arrays

Lesson 3: Refactor earlier projects into Pascal modules

Assessment: Combined task — reimplement a Guessing Game or Quiz with Pascal structure

### Week 5 — Logic and AI (Prolog) / Creative Extensions

Objectives
- Demonstrate declarative programming and logic rules

Lesson 1: Facts, rules, and queries

Lesson 2: Small knowledge base project (family tree / simple quiz)

Lesson 3: Integration — use logic to power a choose-your-own-adventure decision engine

Assessment: Short logic puzzle and code submission

### Week 6 — Systems Thinking (C), Integration & Capstone

Objectives
- Expose students to C — pointers, arrays, structured functions (optional, advanced)
- Consolidate learning with a final project

Lesson 1: C basics and systems-level concepts (memory, arrays)

Lesson 2: Project work time — teacher-assisted

Lesson 3: Presentation day — students share their final projects

Assessment: Final project graded with a rubric (functionality, code clarity, creativity)

## Differentiation and Extension Activities

- For advanced students: Add persistence or file I/O; optional: prototype a simple web frontend (historical Browser platform) without relying on non-active platforms
- For learners needing support: Provide templates, reduce problem complexity, pair with a helper

## Classroom Management Tips

- Encourage pair programming and rotating roles (Driver / Navigator)
- Use a class repository for collecting student work
- Track progress with a shared spreadsheet or learning management system (LMS)

## Example Rubric (Final project)

| Criteria | Excellent | Good | Satisfactory | Needs Work |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Functionality | Works perfectly | Minor issues | Most features work | Many bugs |
| Quality | Clean, reusable code | Some structure | Works but messy | Very disorganized |
| Creativity | Innovative & unique | Good added features | Meets requirements | Basic implementation |
| Documentation | Clear comments & README | Some comments | Few comments | No comments |

If you want, I can export these lesson plans as printable handouts or produce student-facing slides (PowerPoint/Google Slides) for each lesson.
