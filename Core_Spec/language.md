# Time Warp Language Specification (stub)

This document will centralize the cross-platform language reference (BASIC/PILOT/Logo blend) including:

- Statements and aliases (PRINT/TYPE, INPUT/ACCEPT, GOTO/JUMP, loops)
- Expression rules and operator precedence
- Error conventions and emoji prefixes (❌, ✅, ℹ️, 🎨, 🚀, 🐢)

Initial content to be extracted from root `README.md` and platform docs.
