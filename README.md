## What You Can Do

### 🎨 Create Graphics
```logo
REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]  ; Draw a square
```

### 🔢 Learn Programming Fundamentals
```basic
PRINT "What's your name?"
INPUT NAME$
PRINT "Hello, " + NAME$ + "!"
```

### 🤖 Build Interactive Programs
```pilot
MATCH: ACCEPT X
  C: "STOP" → JUMP END
  C: ELSE → PRINT "Continue"
  J: MATCH
END:
```

### 🎮 Develop Games
```forth
: DRAW-PLAYER PEN-DOWN 10 FORWARD PEN-UP ;
: GAME CLEAR 0 MOVE-X ! DRAW-PLAYER ;
```

## Getting Started

### Installation & Launch (Python - Recommended)

**Easiest Way - Automated Launch Script:**

```bash
# Clone and enter repository
git clone https://github.com/James-HoneyBadger/Time_Warp_Studio.git
cd Time_Warp_Studio

# Linux/macOS
./launch_ide.sh

# Windows
launch_ide.bat
```

The script automatically:
- Creates a virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Launches the IDE

**Manual Setup (Alternative):**

```bash
cd Platforms/Python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python time_warp_ide.py
```

See [LAUNCHING.md](LAUNCHING.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### Quick Examples

**1. Hello World in BASIC**
```basic
PRINT "Hello, World!"
```

**2. Draw a Circle in Logo**
```logo
REPEAT 360 [FORWARD 1 RIGHT 1]
```

**3. Guessing Game in PILOT**
```pilot
ACCEPT X(N)
MATCH: ACCEPT Y(N)
  C: Y = X → PRINT "Correct!"
  C: ELSE → JUMP ACCEPT
JUMP ACCEPT
```
